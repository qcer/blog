Always be blogging.

Fortune favours the bold!

Stay hungry,stay foolish!

Move on and work hard.

Learn right, not rote.

Fail fast!

The quick shall inherit the earth!

Keep calm and carry on!

There is pleasure in recognising old thing from a new viewpoint!        --by Mr.Feynman

To every man is given the key to the gates of hell.The same key opens the gates of heaven. --by Mr.Feynman

Don't mistake coincidence for fate.            <<Lost>>

To remember,to let go and to move on.      <<Lost>>

Be the change you want to see in the world.   <<Prison break>>

Sometimes you win and sometimes you learn.  

Venture outside your comfort zone.

Being a dreamer is the new sexy.

Jump out of your bed ready to take on the world!
